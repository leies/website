Hello from Hugo !

this is my first post, i'm trying to move my wordpress to this static site, much faster for mobile, much much more security than wordpress. Of course, the photo ablum effect aren't here. I'm still moving all photos, may takes a pretty long time to go. 

I think in this stage, I wont give up wordpress, since WP provide much fancy effect, maybe this site for mobile view. 

I'm quite enjoy in this site building, learn quite a lot of skills, hugo, terminal, github, vs code, markdown etc. And the new way to update this site, so impress !

Let's see !
