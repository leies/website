Yup, the basic model is formed, super simple and i really love it, load pretty fast and stable, very basic script for photo album. This is pretty great experience for me even this site won't draw any or extremely low traffic, i learn a lot from it. 

well, it's time to think about how this site grow, may add some new photos since they're pretty old. And some improvement like better theme for gallery resizing, more content etc. 

Sept, should be the most busy month for my job, and i hope Oct, Dec will be the same, fuck COVID, fuck Ch___ ! so that may takes more time for this site's content, and I'm planning to give up some domain name, some of blog will be started to delete after I make the backup + htmlize . 

So, probably, end of today, night
