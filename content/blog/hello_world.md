this is my first post, i'm trying to move my wordpress to this static site, much faster for mobile, much much more security than wordpress. Of course, the photo ablum effect aren't here. I'm still moving all photos, may takes a pretty long time to go. 

I've quite enjoy in this site building, learn quite a lot of skills.

Let's see !
