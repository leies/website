Today i've move more photos during no pay leave, lucky, there's still some jobs on going unlike previous months, and surprised me, its better than 2019 (Sept).

I still thinking of how it works on this site, only a mobile site of L e i e s . app ? or something else, still brainstorming of it, no idea yet. Unlike before, i've some topic that can work on.

The one i must buildup that is Punkey's website, using same netlify solution, however there must be huge amount of photos from my phone, cameras, i'm still getting them well arranged, then might need times to resize, and work on the thumbnail. I hope this solution can hold the website as long as it can.

This little boy, had been with me 17 years. One thing I still can't .. really can't predict, when he leave this world, how I will ? i dont know.
